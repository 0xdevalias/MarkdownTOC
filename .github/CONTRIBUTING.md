# Contributing

These are the guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## Issues

File an issue if you think you've found a bug. Please describe

1. How can it be reproduced
2. What was expected
3. What actually occurred
4. What version of the involved component

## Patches

Patches for fixes, features, and improvements are accepted via pull requests.

Pull requests should be based on the master branch, unless you want to contribute to an active branch for a specific topic.

#### Coding Style

You should follow [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) (formerly called pep8).
You can do it easily with [Python PEP8 Autoformat](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20PEP8%20Autoformat).

#### Test

You should use unit-tests for SublimeText by using [UnitTesting](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting) plugin.

1. Install the UnitTesting plugin
2. Comment out or rename your own `MarkdownTOC.sublime-settings` so individual settings are not used during testing
3. [Run tests](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting-example#running-tests)
4. Send Pull Request when tests pass

All contributions are welcome
